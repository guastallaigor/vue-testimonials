### Commitlint :nerd_face:

This project follows the [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) guidelines, with minor changes.

You can commit using `yarn commit` to help you with that.

There's a `pre-push` hook that checks for lint errors before you can push it.

If an error occurs, you can use the `yarn commit:retry` command that runs the previous `yarn commit` that you already filled.

### Documentation :book:

Anything related to documentation should be updated in the same pull request

All documentation are located inside the `docs` folder

To get it up and running, run the following commands:

```sh [docs]
$ yarn && yarn dev
```

It will start at `http://localhost:4000`
