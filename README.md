### Commitlint

This project follows the [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) guidelines, with minor changes.

You can commit using `npm run commit` to help you with that.

There's a `pre-push` hook that checks for lint errors before you can push it.

If an error occurs, you can use the `npm run commit:retry` command that runs the previous `npm run commit` that you already filled.
